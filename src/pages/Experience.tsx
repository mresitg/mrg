              I designed and built Turkey's first talent-exchange platform from scratch. No funding, no team. I handled the product, logic, and launch myself. The platform allows users to trade skills the same way they would trade any real resource.

              I develop n8n-based automation systems for e-commerce brands. These include order flow automation, customer communication workflows, data processing pipelines, and backend operation tools. Every project focuses on the same goal: reducing manual workload and speeding up daily operations.

              I take products from idea to live version. I handle design, logic, prototyping, iteration, and deployment myself. My workflow is simple: build fast, test immediately, improve continuously, ship again.

            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
              I study how artificial intelligence affects human decision-making speed and cognitive workflows. My recent work focuses on how AI-assisted tasks change our mental load, attention patterns, and the way the brain handles problem-solving when part of the process is automated.
              I publish early-stage research, explore experimental ideas, and analyze how human reasoning adapts when supported by AI systems. My current interest is the impact of AI-assisted decision-making on prefrontal processing speed.
